# stoermelder CV-PAM

CV-PAM is like a brother of [CV-MAP](./CVMap.md). While CV-MAP takes some CV and automates any knob, switch or slider, CV-PAM does kind of the opposite: You can attach one of its 32 slots to a parameter of any module and the output generates CV from its movements. Clearly the use-cases for this module aren't that various as for CV-MAP, still you can achieve some interesting scenarios when using live.
