## ENV-expander

The expander INTERMIX-ENV must be placed on the right-side of INTERMIX (or one of its expanders) and outputs envelopes for a specific input column, in case _FADE_ is activated. In other cases it outputs gate-signals whenever the pad is active.

INTERMIX-ENV was added in v1.10 of PackOne.

## FADE-expander

The expander INTERMIX-FADE must be placed on the right-side of INTERMIX (or one of its expanders) and allows custom fade values for each pad of a selected input column. It can be used to set the values for fade-in and fade-out the same time or fade-in only or fade-out only. When the expander is detached or configured for another input column the default values from the main-module reapply.
