# stoermelder SAIL

SAIL is an utility module. It allows to control any module parameter which is currently hovered by the mouse pointer by CV. Movements are calculated by delta on the input voltage. If the MOD-port is high (>=1V) the parameter control precision is increased by 10.

This module is especially helpful if used together with VCV MIDI-CC: You can map a specific MIDI CC and change any parameter currently hovered with the same control on your MIDI device.

SAIL was added in v1.5.0 of PackOne.
